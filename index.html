SEV-SNP, the latest addition, ensures integrity via the Reverse Map Table (RMP) that stops the hypervisor from tampering guest page mappings. AMD uses RMP entries to protect the rest of the RMP, thus causing a Catch-22 during the RMP setup phase. To address this, SEV-SNP relies on AMD's Platform Security Processor (PSP), that resides next to the x86 cores executing SEV-SNP VMs, to perform the RMP initialization. During initialization, only PSP should be able to alter the RMP memory. All other memory accesses must be fenced, especially from the x86 cores. We present RMPocalypse, a novel attack that shows a critical gap in the security of RMP initialization, wherein the x86 cores maliciously control parts of the initial RMP state. Our analysis shows that the vulnerability arises due to the complex, but insufficient, interplay of multiple hardware components and distributed access controls. To show the impact of our finding, we exploit this gap to break confidentiality and integrity guarantees of SEV-SNP. We demonstrate RMPocalypse by enabling debug on production-mode CVMs, faking attestation, VMSA state replay, and code injection"}]}</script>

            <p>
                Confidential computing allows customers to off-load their computation to the cloud without having to
                trust the cloud provider. One of the approaches to enable confidential computing is by anchoring the
                trust in the hardware. AMD’s SEV-SNP, one such hardware mechanism, supports confidential computing by
                creating confidential virtual machines. With RMPocalypse, we demonstrate an attack on all AMD processors
                that support SEV-SNP (Zen 3/4/5) and compromise all confidential computing guarantees.

                Reverse Map Table, in short RMP, is one of the main protection mechanisms in SEV-SNP to stop the
                hypervisor from accessing the confidential virtual machines. In RMPocalypse, we exploit AMD’s incomplete
                protections that allow us to perform a single memory write to the RMP, thus breaking SEV-SNP.

            </p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-2">What is AMD SEV-SNP? </h2>
            <p>
                Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging, SEV-SNP for short, is AMD’s latest hardware
                extension to support confidential computing.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-2">What is RMP? </h2>
            <p>
                SEV-SNP uses a data structure called Reverse Map Table (RMP) to store security metadata for all DRAM
                pages in the system. Since RMP can be large in size, it is stored in the DRAM. Now you might ask, who
                protects the RMP? Well, the RMP! Easier said than done, as this design choice by AMD creates a
                chicken-and-egg problem. The main challenge lies in the initialization, when the RMP is being set up in
                the DRAM, there has to be an orthogonal mechanism in place to make sure this is done correctly. Only
                after a successful initialization can the RMP protect itself (and of course the confidential VMs). AMD
                has an elegant solution to this problem. They use a security co-processor called the PSP to initialize
                the RMP. During initialization, platform protection mechanisms configured by the PSP protect the RMP.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-2">What went wrong?</h2>
            <p>
                RMPocalypse shows that AMD’s platform protection mechanisms are not complete, thus leaving a small
                window of opportunity for the attacker to maliciously overwrite the RMP on initialization. Due to the
                design of the RMP, a single overwrite of 8 bytes within the RMP causes the entire RMP to become
                subsequently compromised. With a compromised RMP, all integrity guarantees of SEV-SNP become void.
                RMPocalypse case studies show that an attacker-controlled RMP not only voids the integrity but also
                results in a full breach of confidentiality.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-2">What can an attacker do with this vulnerability?</h2>
            <p>
                We showcase RMPocalypse primitives by forging attestation values, enabling debug, reading and writing arbitrary encrypted CVM memory, and replaying the CVM register state.

        <article class="text-justify text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-900 space-y-6">
            <p>
                AMD performs an initialization step when the hypervisor wants to enable SEV-SNP on the platform. Setting
                up the RMP is one of the critical steps in this initialization. Thus, during initialization, AMD blocks
                all the memory accesses to the memory region that holds the RMP data structure. In particular, AMD uses
                so-called Trusted Memory Regions (TMRs) to block any access from untrusted components (e.g., x86 cores).
            </p>
            <p>
                In our analysis of the RMP initialization, we observed that the malicious hypervisor running on the x86
                cores can still create dirty cachelines pointing to DRAM. As the TMR barrier only stops the memory
                access at the memory controller level, it cannot stop cache pollution. Note that this in itself does not
                compromise SEV-SNP yet, since the RMP is still intact in memory at this point and if the attacker tries
                to flush the entry, the TMR will block it. It is after the initialization, when AMD lifts the TMR
                barrier, when we can perform the flush, and the write goes through to the DRAM!
            </p>
            <p>
                In summary, we identify the root-cause as the misalignment of different memory protection mechanisms on
                the platform.

                Figure (a) shows the main components of our attack with x86 cores and caches connected to the DRAM over
                an interconnect. During SEV-SNP init, as shown in (b), a malicious hypervisor creates dirty cachelines
                pointing to RMP memory.
                Then it lets the PSP setup the RMP per usual and waits for the acknowledgement that the initialization
                is complete. In particular, after writing to the RMP range the PSP notifies the platform to switch from
                the TMR protection mechanism and start enforcing SEV-SNP semantics. Concretely, this means that the TMR
                access checks are lifted and the core starts enforcing RMP checks on memory accesses. However, these RMP
                checks occur before the memory write gets written to cache. Thus, all data within the cache is assumed
                to be valid and already complies with the current security semantics. This leaves us with a time window
                during RMP initialization, where the x86 cores can flush the previously created dirty cacheline entries.
                They are neither subject to access control checks based on the TMR nor the RMP, thus bypassing both
                protection mechanisms. As depicted in (c), the malicious hypervisor can use the primitive to get
                arbitrary unchecked writes to RMP memory.

            <p>
                We perform the above RMP corruption during the SEV initialization. RMPocalypse is deterministic since
                our malicious write always goes through. Next, with our choice of corrupting the root RMP entry with
                this write, we can tamper with all RMP entries in the system and the logic state they belong to. Our
                paper explains the detailed analysis of the RMP states. But in short, the RMP write-protects a critical
                metadata page for CVMs. This page holds security sensitive information, such as debug-enable bit and the
                attestation hash. With the RMP checks practically disabled, we show how to corrupt these metadata pages
                to enable debug mode and bypass attestation. With each of these primitives, we can arbitrarily tamper
                with the execution of the confidential VMs and exfiltrate all secrets with 100% success rate.
